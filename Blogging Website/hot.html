            <p>Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computation, leveraging principles from quantum
                mechanics to process and store information in a fundamentally different way compared to classical
                computers. Unlike classical computers that use bits (binary units of 0s and 1s), quantum computers
                use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to the principles
                of superposition and entanglement. <br> <br>
                Key concepts in quantum computing: <br>
                Superposition: Qubits can exist in a superposition of states, meaning they can represent both 0 and
                1 simultaneously, allowing quantum computers to perform multiple calculations at once. <br><br>
                Entanglement: Qubits can become entangled, where the state of one qubit becomes interconnected with
                the state of another. Changes to one qubit instantly affect its entangled partner, enabling faster
                communication and computation.
                <br><br>
                Quantum Gates: Similar to classical logic gates in traditional computers, quantum gates manipulate
                qubits' states to perform operations like NOT, AND, or OR gates. <br>
